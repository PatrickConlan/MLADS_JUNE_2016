The repo contains the code for the tutorial: Introduction to R for Statistical Analysis, Visualization and Predictive Analytics
There are three kinds of files:
  .R files are script files containing R code
  .Rmd files contain R code with additional commands to built the .html files
  .html files are the finished module for each lesson
  
There are 8 modules all together. We will attempt to cover the first 6 during the tutorial. The remaining two modules
will help you continue learning after the tutorial.
